# Gameplay Mechanics in Detail

### World-Building and Exploration

RDR2’s open world is one of the most richly detailed environments ever created. The game doesn't just give players a playground; it gives them a living world to interact with. Towns like Valentine and Saint Denis feel distinct, with their own architectural styles, cultural nuances, and NPC behaviours.

- **Dynamic Encounters**: While exploring, players may come across stranded travellers, ambushes, rival gangs, or even strange events like ghost sightings. These encounters make the world feel unpredictable and alive.
- **Environmental Storytelling**: The world is littered with abandoned houses, graves, and other remnants of the past, each telling its own silent story.

### Core Systems

Arthur’s health, stamina, and dead-eye abilities are managed through “cores.” These cores require maintenance through food, rest, and proper clothing for the weather. The system demands attention but never feels overly punishing, striking a balance between realism and gameplay.

- **Hunting and Crafting**: Hunting plays a significant role in the game. Each animal has unique behaviours, and killing them cleanly yields better pelts for crafting gear. The hunting mechanic is so detailed that even the direction of the wind affects your prey's awareness.
- **Camp Management**: The Van der Linde gang’s camp acts as a hub for upgrading facilities, managing resources, and interacting with fellow members. Contributing to the camp’s needs strengthens bonds with characters and adds layers of realism.

### Combat System

The combat in RDR2 is deliberate and grounded, emphasizing strategy over fast-paced action. The *Dead Eye* system evolves throughout the game, allowing players to tag enemies in slow motion for cinematic gunfights.

- **Variety in Weapons**: From revolvers to shotguns, every weapon feels distinct. Weapons can be customized for performance and aesthetics, adding a personal touch to the arsenal.
- **Stealth**: Though less emphasized, stealth plays a role in certain missions and hunting. Arthur can use throwing knives, bows, or silenced pistols to take out enemies quietly.
